			<h2>Overview</h2>
			In this homework, I implemented several components of a mesh editor are incredibly important in the world of 3D modeling/design. First, I implemented the evaluation of bézier curves and surfaces with de Casteljau's algorithm, which allows the program to display continuous, curving lines/surfaces in 3D. Next I improved the editor's shading capabilities by implementing a function that calculates area-weighted vertex normals. These normals can then be interpolated between, allowing the editor to calculate shading on a per-pixel basis rather than per-triangle. Next, I added some features that let the user change the actual topology of a mesh, like edge flip and edge split operations. Finally, I used edge flip and split operations to help implement Loop subdivision. Of all the things I've built in this assignment, I'm incredibly impressed by the power of Loop subdivision to completely change the shape of an initially simple mesh. Watching it round off the corners of a simplistic cube mesh and dramatically increase the number of vertices/edges with a single button press is fascinating. I also find myself incredibly impressed at the speed with which my mesh editor can process data when subdividing meshes with tens of thousands (or more) vertices and edges. This homework also gave me the opportunity to do lots of low-level memory mangament work in order to implement edge flip and edge split, both of which involve lot of pointer reassignments and (in the case of edge split) involve adding edges and vertices to a mesh. There are many more moving parts to keep track of than I initially thought when these operations were presented in class, and it felt great seeing things work properly after drawing out several diagrams and carefully planning out the order in which I should reassign values to make sure every halfedge, edge, vertex, and face was accounted for. Lastly, I thought the lighting/shading effect I acheived through area-weighted vertex norms was incredibly cool and looked very good considering the relative simplicity of its implementation. I'd be very curious to see how much I can improve upon this lighting with things like ray tracing or even path tracing in later assignments/projects.
			<h2>Section I: Bezier Curves and Surfaces</h2>

			<h3>Part 1: Bezier curves with 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>
			In Homework 1, we displayed the ability to draw objects to the screen through the use of points, lines, and triangles. We were even able to mimic curved shapes by drawing lots of lines/triangles oriented at slightly different angles, giving the appearance of a continuous curve despite its piecewise nature. As mentioned in lecture, however, things like camera paths, object modeling, vector fonts, and CAD design necessitate geometry that is truly smooth in order to function properly. We can acheive the ability to represent smooth curves by employing bézier curves, a type of geometry defined by a number of control points (and parameterized by a value <i>t</i>) that allow us to mathematically derive natural-looking curves that can be scaled infinitely without losing fidelity. In order to get from a list of control points to a curve that can be displayed on screen, we can apply the de Casteljau algorithm for evaluating bézier curves.
			<p>To evaluate a point on a bézier curve with <i>n</i> control points located at point <i>t</i> (0 ≤ <i>t</i> ≤ 1)</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Using <i>t</i>, linearly interpolate between each consecutive pair of control points, resulting in <i>n-1</i> intermediate control points.
				</li>
				<li>
					Repeat step 1 with the intermediate control points, creating another set of intermediate control points.
				</li>
				<li>
					Recursively interpolate until you are left with a single point. This point is located on the curve.
				</li>
			</ol>
			When it came to implementing Part 1, I coded <code>BezierCurve::evaluateStep()</code>, which executes the recursive step of de Casteljau's algorithm. I did this by looping through <code>points</code> and returning a new vector of points called <code>result</code> that contains the interpolated control points.

			<p>With the recursive step of de Casteljau implemented, I can now display the full process of evaluating a point on a bézier curve.</p>

			<h3>Part 2: Bezier surfaces with separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
			At the moment, our mesh editor is capable of rendering smooth curves in 2 dimensions, but we want to be able to represent smooth surfaces in 3D. This means we need to add support for bézier surfaces. Currently, my implementation of de Casteljau only works with a 1 dimensional array of control points. In order to extend things to 3D, we can modify it to work with an <i>n × n</i> array of control points, with each row in the array defining a bézier curve. We can then evaluate each row of control points using a parameter <i>u</i>. After doing so, we'll have <i>n</i> points that each lie on a particular curve. Those <i>n</i> points can then be used as control points for <b>another</b> bézier curve parameterized by <i>v</i>. Upon evaluating this new curve according to <i>v</i>, we will be left with a point that lies on a 3D bézier surface. With this knowledge, we can cycle through different values of <i>u</i> and <i>v</i>, allowing us to represent perfectly smooth patches of geometry in our mesh editor.

			<p>To implement this myself, I had to make changes in 3 functions: <code>BezierPatch::evaluateStep()</code>, <code>BezierPatch::evaluate1D()</code>, and <code>BezierPatch::evaluate()</code>. The code for  <code>BezierPatch::evaluateStep()</code> ended up being essentially identical to the code I wrote for Part 1, the only difference being this function uses the value <i>t</i> passed into the function for interpolation rather than using a member varible of the class like before</p>

			<p>For <code>BezierPatch::evaluate1D()</code> I needed to take in a vector of control points <code>points</code> and a parameter <code>t</code> and return the point that lies on the curve defined by <code>points</code>. The function works as follows</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Define a variable <code>curr_step</code> and set it equal to points</li>
				<li>Enter a loop where <code>curr_step</code> is set equal to the result of <code>evaluateStep(curr_step, t)</code>, This represents one step of the de Casteljau algorithm.</li>
				<li>If the length of <code>curr_step</code> is 1 after the call to <code>evaluate_step()</code>, return the point stored in <code>curr_step</code> because we have derived point that lies on the current bézier curve. If not, continue looping.</li>
			</ol>

			With <code>BezierPatch::evaluateStep()</code> and <code>BezierPatch::evaluate1D()</code> now implemented, I coded <code>BezierPatch::evaluate()</code> (which takes in two parameters <i>u</i> and <i>v</i>) to complete the separable 1D de Casteljau algorithm.
			<ol>
				<li>Define a new vector <code>control_points_v</code></li>
				<li>Loop through each row of <code>this->control_points</code>, pushing the result of <code>evaluate1D(this->controlPoints[i], u)</code> to the back of <code>control_points_v</code>.</li>
				<li>After looping through each row of control points, return the result of <code>evaluate1D(control_pts_v, v)</code>, as this represents the final evaluated point on the bézier surface</li>
			</ol>

			Now that I can represent smooth patches of 3D geometry, my mesh editor is able to display 3D meshes!

			<h2>Section II: Triangle Meshes and Half-Edge Data Structure</h2>

			<h3>Part 3: Area-weighted vertex normals</h3>
			The next improvement to be made in my mesh editor has to do with shading. At the moment, every triangle in a given mesh is shaded flatly, meaning each triangle has one normal vector that determines the color of every pixel inside of it. This makes it difficult to shade objects with smooth, continuous surfaces. Instead, we want to define a normal for every vertex in the mesh, which will allow us to interpolate colors/shading across the triangle using barycentric coordinates. This is called Phong shading, and results in something that looks much more natural than flat shading. In order to do this, I implemented area-weighted vertex normals by filling in <code>Vertex::normal</code>. My implementation works as follows:
			<ol>
				<li>Define a zero vector <code>result</code> that will hold the final area-weighted normal vector for this vertex.</li>
				<li>Set <code>h</code> equal to the halfedge rooted at the current vertex.</li>
				<li>
					Enter a do-while loop which traverses through faces incident on the current vertex until we end up back at the halfedge rooted at this vertex.
					<ul>
						<li>Use halfedge traveral operations to locate the other two vertices <code>v1</code> and <code>v2</code> in the current face.</li>
						<li>Calculate the distance bewteen this vertex and the other two vertices in the triangle. Multiply the distances together to get the area of the current face</li>
						<li>Create two vectors, one between this vertex and <code>v1</code>, the other between <code>v1</code> and <code>v2</code> and calculate the cross product</li>
						<li>Scale the cross product (normal vector) by the area of the face and add the vector to <code>result</code> </li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Normalize <code>result</code> and return it.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Now that every vertex in a given mesh will have a unit normal vector associated with it when we enable Phong shading, we are able to vastly improve the appearance of 3D ojects, as seen below.</p>

			<h3>Part 4: Edge flip</h3>
			When it came to implementing edge flips, I really concerned myself with planning out all of the pointer reassignments that needed to take place so that I would not have to try to debug any confusing errors later on. To make things easier on myself, I assumed every edge flip operation looked like the diagram below, where the halfedge associated with the edge we want to flip is rooted at vertex b:
			<figure>
				<img src="images/task4_graph.png" alt="Edge Flip" style="width:600px" />
				<figcaption>Diagram of an edge flip operation</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>Additionally, I split my code into distinct sections (and added plently of comments) that helped me structure each individual step of the operation because I felt it allowed me to think things through more thoroughly. After performing a boundary check, I grouped my pointer reassignments by face. Referring to the diagram above, I made sure to set the next, twin, vertex, edge, and face pointer for every halfedge in face ABC before dealing with the halfedges in face BCD. I also found it extremely helpful to define variables with meaningful names for the various <code>VertexIter</code>, <code>EdgeIter</code>, and <code>HalfedgeIter</code> objects I would use throughout the pointer reassignment process (ex. edge_ab, vertex_b, etc.). This coding approach along with my pre-planning helped me sucessfully implement <code>HalfedgeMesh::flipEdge()</code> without a painful debugging process. The pictures below display my mesh editor's edge flipping functionality in action. Due to the fact that this function solely involves pointer reassignments, I can ensure the function executes in constant time, regardless of the size of the mesh.</p>

				<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">

			</div>

			<h3>Part 5: Edge split</h3>
			Next, I implemented edge splits. I used the same approach as I did for edge flips, only this time I needed to be more careful, as edge splits involve many more pointer reassignments than edge flips <b>and</b> require adding new mesh elements. My implementation of <code>HalfedgeMesh::splitEdge()</code> creates one new vertex (vertex m), two new faces, three new edges, and six new halfedges. Once again, I referred to a diagram to help me visualize the edge split operation and help me group my pointer reassignments by face.
			<figure>
				<img src="images/task5_graph.png" alt="Edge Split" style="width:600px" />
				<figcaption>Diagram of an edge split operation</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>As before, I did lots of pre-planning when it came to how I would go about assigning pointers. Splitting things up by face proved to be incredibly helpful once again, as it allowed me to break the problem down into several manageable chunks. In my implementation, I chose not to use <code>Halfedge::setNeighbors()</code> because I preferred seeing each pointer assignment written out individually, thinking it would make it easier to spot any inconsistencies. While I do think this approach helped a bit when it came to compartmentalizing my approach, it resulted in the function taking up almost 150 lines of code, which is not very ideal for readability. Like with Part 4, this operation also runs in constant time given that it is essentially just a bunch of pointer assignments. As seen below, this gives us the ability to edit 3D meshes in a new way. We can even combine edge flips with edge splits to subdivide surfaces, allowing us to increase the resolution of our models.</p>

			</div>

			<p>While I did not run into any major debugging issues at first, I would eventually have to revisit my implementation for part 5 after completing part 6. After coding Loop subdivision for mesh upsampling, I was running into an issue where upsampled meshes would form geometric inconsistencies, seemingly out of nowhere. Below, I'm using <i>dae/icosahedron/input.dae</i> to demonstate the issue.</p>
			<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
				<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">
					<tr>

				</table>
			</div>
			At first, I believed the issue stemmed from the section of the Loop subdivision algorithm where you recalculate vertex positions. After all, what else would cause vertices to end up in the wrong place after subdividing? Unfortunately, I could not find an issue with my part 6 implementation that would cause something like this. The answer eventually came after I took the time to manually step through the subdivision algorithm on the center pentagon shape in <i>dae/icosahedron/input.dae</i>, one of the areas that sufferred from this issue when subdividing. After splitting all of the edges around the center of the pentagon, I noticed the degree of the center vertex had changed from 5 to 4 when it should not have. This told me that I was not properly referencing/assigning the new halfedges being created in my edge split implementation, causing the degree of the center vertex to change because there was no halfedge rooted there. Luckily, this was a fairly quick fix. Referencing the edge split diagram above, all I needed to do was add the following code to make sure everything was being properly accounted for:
			<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
				<pre>
				<code>
a->halfedge() = a_to_m;
b->halfedge() = b_to_m;
c->halfedge() = c_to_m;
d->halfedge() = d_to_m;
					</code>
				</pre>
			</div>
			<h3>Part 6: Loop subdivision for mesh upsampling</h3>
			For the last part of the assignment, I needed to implement Loop subdivision for mesh upsampling, an incredibly powerful algorithm that can be used to incease the resolution of a given mesh without requiring an artist/modeler to redo anything. Luckily, the spec contained pretty thorough notes on how to go about implementing the algorithm. Additionally, <code>MeshResampler::upsample()</code> already contained comments that outlined a general approach. This allowed me to jump right in, eventually resulting in the following solution:
			<ol>
				<li>Loop through all vertices in the input mesh and calculate their new position. For each vertex <code>v</code>, I defined a vector <code>original_neighbor_position_sum</code> and value <code>u</code>, which was equal to either <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub> or <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>(8*n)</sub> depending on the vertex degree <code>n</code>. Then, iterate though all neighboring vertices an add their position to <code>original_neighbor_position_sum</code>. After completing the loop, set <code>v->newPosition</code> to <code>(1 - n * u) * v->position + u * original_neighbor_position_sum</code>. Lastly, set <code>v->isNew</code> to false to ensure that the program knows it is a part of the original mesh.</li>
				<li>Next, iterate through every edge in the mesh and calculate the position of the new vertex that will be located in the middle of that edge when we split it later on. Using halfedge traversal, we can get the positions of the four vertices (a, b, c, d) surrounding a particular edge <code>e</code>. Then, set <code>e->newPosition</code> equal to <code>3/8 * (a + b) + 1/8 * (c + d)</code> as described in lecture. I also set <code>e->isNew</code> to false to make sure it was considered part of the original mesh.</li>
				<li>Split every edge in the original mesh in any order. I did this by looping through every edge in the mesh, checking if the current edge was not new and that neither of the vertices that make up the current edge are new. If so, split the edge. After doing so, mark the newly created vertex <code>m</code> as new and mark edges AM and MD (using the edge split diagram from above as reference) as new. Since edges CM and MB lie in the original edge path, we do not mark them as new. If we did mark them as new, it would cause problems when we flip edges in the next step. At this point I also set <code>m->newPosition</code> equal to the new position value I stored in the edge earlier.</li>
				<li>Iterate through all of the edges, chekcing if the current edge is new and, if so, it connects an old vertex to a new vertex. If all of that is true, flip the current edge.</li>
				<li>Lastly, iterate through all vertices and set <code>v->position</code> to <code>v->newPosition</code>.</li>
			</ol>

			<p>With Loop subdivision now properly implemented, we can take low-poly meshes and turn them into high definition models! When subdividing models, sharp edges and corners tend to round out and soften quite a bit as a result of the new position calculations we're doing. The meshes also tend to shrink a bit as well as the vertices contract towards each other.<p>
				<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
					<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">
						<tr>

								<figcaption>dae/torus/input.dae after 3 levels of subdivision</figcaption>
							</td>
						</tr>
					</table>
				</div>
			<p>The rounding effect is especially noticable with simple meshes that contain long edges since the new position of a particular vertex is heavily influenced by vertices that are far away, causing a big change in position. To reduce this effect, we can pre-split edges around corners/edges so that the position of vertices in the are only being influenced by vertices that are closeby. This helps retain some sharpness, as seen below:</p>
			<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
				<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">
					<tr>
						<td style="text-align: center;">

						<td style="text-align: center;">
							<img src="images/task6_4.png" width="400px" />
							<figcaption>Mesh after 3 levels of subdivision</figcaption>
						</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
			</div>
			<p>Although its fairly messy in this instance, one can see that the extra edge splits have helped that section of the mesh retain more of its original geometry. If we split all the edges on the mesh a few times before subdividing, we would see much less rounding as a result of the position interpolation/approximation we're doing as a part of Loop subdivision.</p>
			<p>Next, we can take a look at <i>dae/cube.dae</i>, and notice that the cube looks a bit asymmetrical after multiple levels of Loop subdivision.</p>
			<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
				<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">
					<tr>
						<td style="text-align: center;">
							<img src="images/task6_5.png" width="400px" />
							<figcaption>Original Mesh<figcaption>
						</td>
						<td style="text-align: center;">

						</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
			</div>
			<p>The main driver behind this asymmetry is number of edges in the cube. In addition to the 12 edges that typically make up a cube, there is a diagonal edge on each face giving us a total of 18 edges. Despite that, we still only have 8 vertices. As a result, the vertices do not all have the same degree, meaning their positions are affected differently when we calculate <code>(1 - n * u) * v->position + u * original_neighbor_position_sum</code>. Subsequent levels of subdivision propogate this asymmetry. In order to combat this, we can try to pre-process the cube by splitting each of the diagonal edges. After doing so, all vertices have degree 6.</p>
			<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
				<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">
					<tr>
						<td style="text-align: center;">

			<p>Since all vertices now have the same degree and the edge lengths of the cube are equal by definition, we can guarantee that calculating <code>(1 - n * u) * v->position + u * original_neighbor_position_sum</code> for each of the original 8 vertices will result in a mesh that is symmetrical about the origin. Given that the mesh is symmetrical about the origin, applying subsequent levels of subdivision will <b>also</b> result in a symmetrical mesh.</p>
