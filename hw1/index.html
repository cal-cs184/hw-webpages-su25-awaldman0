			<h2>Task 1: Drawing Single-Color Triangles</h2>
			When rasterizing triangles for this task, my goal was to take point data and appropriately translate it into graphical data that appears on screen. In doing so, I would use the color data passed into <code>RasterizerImp::rasterize_triangle()</code> to fill in
			the triangle I was working with. While rasterizing a single triangle does not look very impressive, repeated calls to the function allows me to display a great deal of triangles on screen, giving my rasterizer the ability to represent fairly intricate and
			complex geometry.

			In general, my triangle rasterization algorithm works by first sampling the center of each pixel within the bouding box of the triangle. If the center of the pixel lies in the triangle, I draw it to the screen.
			In detail, the algorithm works as follows:

			<ol>
				<li>
					When checking if a point lies within a triangle, my algorithm assumes the points <code>(x0, y0), (x1, y1),</code> and <code>(x2, y2)</code> are in counterclockwise winding order. Therefore, I need to ensure the x and y values passed into the function are in counterclockwise order by the time I do any bounds checking. I do this by creating two vectors, one between <code>(x0, y0)</code> and <code>(x1, y1)</code> and the other bewteen <code>(x1, y1)</code> and <code>(x2, y2)</code> and computing the cross product.
					If the cross product is negative, the point data is in clockwise order, in which case I swap the values of <code>(x1, y1) </code> and <code>(x2, y2)</code> to ensure a counterclockwise winding order.
				</li>
				<li>Define a vector for each side of the triangle and its corresponding normal vector</li>
				<li>Among the x and y values passed into the function, find the smallest and largest x and y values. Then take the <code>floor()</code> of those values and add 0.5, which gives us the coordinates of the center of each pixel that defines the triangle's bounding box.</li>
				<li>Iterate through each pixel in the bounding box, checking if the center of the current pixel is in the triangle by calculating the dot product of the vector bewteen the "first" point in each side of the triangle and the current coordinate with its cooresponding normal vector.</li>
				<li>If the current point lies on screen and he dot product is greater than or equal to 0 (to ensure we rasterize the edges in addition to interior points) for all three sides, then we draw it on screen.</li>
			</ol>

			My algorithm is no worse than one that checks each sample within the bounding box of the triangle (since that is exactly how it works), but it lacks certain optimizations that could improve performance like tiled triangle traversal.

			Pictured below is a <i>png</i> screenshot of my rasterizer displaying <i>basic/test4.svg</i> with the default viewing parameters with the pixel inspector hovering over an area close to the corner of a very thin triangle.

			</figure>

			As you can see, our image is suffering from jaggies, and even leaves some pixels blank where the triangle does quite pass through the center of a pixel. This kind of aliasing is occuring because we only sample the <b>center</b> of each pixel when rasterizing, not allowing us to represent the geometry in an accurate or appealing way.


			<h2>Task 2: Antialiasing by Supersampling</h2>
			In order to remedy the aliasing seen in the screenshot from task 1, I implemented supersampling functionality into the rasterizer. Supersampling works by sampling multiple points <b>within</b> a single pixel and averaging out the results in order to determine a pixel's final color. This way, whether or not a triangle passes through the center of a pixel is no longer the sole factor when it comes to determining how a pixel is colored in. Supersampling is extremely helpful for getting rid of jaggies because it allows you to soften the edges of your geometry by blending edge pixels with those around them. When sampling, pixel/color data is initially stored in the <code>sample_buffer</code> vector before being finalized and put into <code>rgb_framebuffer_target</code> (which contains the data actually drawn to the screen). Since I need to store multiple samples per pixel and have to accomodate multiple potential sampling rates, I had to make some changes to the way my rasterizer manages memory to allow <code>sample_buffer</code> to be resized depending on the current sample rate.

			In order to implement supersampling and support multiple supersampling rates, I did the following:

			<ol>
				<li>
					In <code>RasterizerImp::set_sample_rate()</code>, I changed <code>this->sample_rate</code> to equal the rate passed into the fucntion and altered the call to <code>resize()</code> to scale the size of the vector by the rate passed into the function.
				</li>
				<li>
					In <code>RasterizerImp::set_framebuffer_target()</code>, I altered the call to <code>resize()</code> to scale the size of the vector by the rate passed into the function.
				</li>
				<li>
					I left <code>RasterizerImp::clear_buffers()</code> unchanged.
				</li>
			</ol>

			Next, I needed to actually implement supersampling functionality, which involved changing my implementation for <code>RasterizerImp::rasterize_triangle()</code> and <code>RasterizerImp::fill_pixel()</code>.

			I made the following changes to <code>RasterizerImp::rasterize_triangle()</code>:

			<ol>
				<li>
					Within the nested for loop used to iterate through each pixel in the triangle's bounding box, I added another nested for loop that would perform <code>sqrt(sample_rate) * sqrt(sample_rate)</code> samples at uniformally distributed locations within the current pixel.
				</li>
				<li>
					I defined a variable <i>offset</i> equal to <code>1 / sqrt(this->sample_rate)</code>.
				</li>
				<li>
					For pixel <code>(i, j)</code> and sub-pixel location <code>(k, l)</code> I sampled at <code>(i + (k * offset) + (offset / 2), j + (l * offset) + (offset / 2))</code>, which resulted in evenly distributed samples within the pixel.
				</li>
				<li>I performed the sample in-triangle tests as before, making sure to store the result at the proper index of <code>sample_buffer</code>, whose size changed depending on the sample rate</li>
			</ol>

			Then, I altered <code>RasterizerImp::fill_pixel()</code> to set all of the indices corresponding to a particular pixel in <code>sample_buffer</code> to the same color so that the rasterizer could still render points and lines normally even after all of the samples within a pixel were averaged out.

			Finally, I changed <code>RasterizerImp::resolve_to_framebuffer()</code> such that for each pixel <code>(x, y)</code>, the function iterated through each sub-pixel sample, adding up the red, green, and blue componenets of the color stored at that location in <code>sample_buffer</code>. The function then divides the sums by the number of samples to obtain the average values of the red, green, and blue componenets of a particular pixel. Lastly, these average values are converted to 8-bit values and passed into <code>rgb_framebuffer_target</code>.

			The results of using supersampling in my rasterizer can be seen below, as the edges look much smoother when the sampling rate is higher. Supersampling allows the rasterizer also performs much better when it comes to displaying very thin pieces of geometry, as it no longer leaves a pixel totally blank when a triangle does not happen to overlap with its center.
